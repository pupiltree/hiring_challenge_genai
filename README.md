- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Create a clean, responsive UI
- Include a simple results page showing all generated variations

### Evaluation Criteria
- Quality of generated ad content
- Code organization and quality
- Creative approach to the problem
- Performance and reliability
- Documentation quality

## Submission Guidelines
1. Fork our challenge repository

   - Setup instructions
   - Architecture explanation
   - Model selection justification
   - Future improvement ideas
4. Include a Dockerfile that properly builds and runs your application
5. Submit a pull request to our main repository

## Bonus Points
- Implement A/B preference testing for ad variations
- Add customization options (aspect ratio, tone, style)
- Include analytics to track which variations perform better
- Optimize for performance/cost

This challenge is designed to be completed in a single day while demonstrating your skills with generative AI models and application development.
